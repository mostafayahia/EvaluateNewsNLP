# Evaluate News NLP Project

This project is an implementation for what we have learned in Build-Tools Front-End Udacity Course.<br>
The goal is to make webpack configuration in both "dev" & "prod" mode. Also make call to NLP API with some text 
<br>and display the result of the request in `index.html`.

You can run the project by simply navigating to the root directory of the project then run the following commands:
```

npm run start # starting express server on port 8081
npm run build-prod # build project in dist directory and can check result on express server(localhost:8081)
```
